# Grid System

A new Grid System has been created to help standardise the layout and the spacing across components and make it easier to build responsive layouts.

The grid system uses two structural components, Row and Column. This is inspired by the GOV.UK Design System Grid System.

https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/layout/#grid-system

## Row

The Row is the outer container and is the full width of it's parent container. It should only contain Column components as it's direct descendents.

### hasBorder

You may also pass in `hasBorder` into the Column props to display the border. This should only be used for demonstration purposes in development and not in the production code.

## Column

Columns belong within a Row component. The Column allows you to pass in the column width for `small`, `medium` and `large` breakpoints as props.

The available options for the Column widths are:

- full
- one-half
- one-third
- two-thirds
- one-quarter
- three-quarters

The default values will be:

- full for small
- one-half for medium
- one-third for large

### hasPadding

You may also pass in `hasPadding={false}` into the Column props to disable the default padding.

### hasBorder

You may also pass in `hasBorder` into the Column props to display the border. This should only be used for demonstration purposes in development and not in the production code.

## Example

```jsx
<Row>
  <Column small="full" medium="full" large="full">
    <div>Full width</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="one-half" medium="one-half" large="one-half">
    <div>One half</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="one-half" medium="one-half" large="one-half">
    <div>One half</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="three-quarters" medium="three-quarters" large="three-quarters">
    <div>Three quarters</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="one-quarter" medium="one-quarter" large="one-quarter">
    <div>One quarter</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="one-third" medium="one-third" large="one-third">
    <div>One third</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="two-thirds" medium="two-thirds" large="two-thirds">
    <div>Two thirds</div>
  </Column>
</Row>
```
