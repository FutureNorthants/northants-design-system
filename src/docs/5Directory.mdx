# Directory

The directory components are designed to follow the [Open Referral UK](https://api.porism.com/ServiceDirectoryService/swagger-ui/index.html) data structure for services, with the filters from Taxonomies. The types have been created to mirror the expected response from the API.

The components are purely for displaying the data, with the Frontend website responsible for querying the API and passing the results into the components in the design system.

This allows the design system to focus on the look and feel of the components, and allows the frontend website to server side render the page.

## Directory Service List

The `DirectoryServiceList` is designed to display a list of services with filters. The text and postcode filters in the top of the page are standard, but the filters in the left column are passed in as props through categories.

Updating the state is also passed to the parent component, such as the frontend page that fetches the data from the API.

The label in category is used as the accordion label. The category options can be set to display as radio buttons by setting singleSelection to `true` or to checkboxes by setting singleSelection to `false`.

## Directory Service

The `DirectoryService` component is designed to display a single service. The component will only display the opening hours and location sections if the data is passed in with the service prop.

A service can have many locations and each location can have many addresses, although generally each service will only have one location, with a single address.

The DirectoryService component uses the short list, so it is required to be wrapped in the `DirectoryShortListProvider`.

## Directory Map

The Directory Map component uses Google Maps and require an API key set in the environment variables using the below key:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=
```

**Ensure that the API key has the relevant domains eanabled in the Google Developer Console.**

The component checks if cookies have been allowed. If they have, it will display an interactive JavaScript map. If cookies are not enabled, it will display the static image map.

The JavaScript maps (not StaticMap component) need to be wrapped in the `@googlemaps/react-wrapper` and have the API key passed in as a prop.

```jsx
import { Wrapper } from '@googlemaps/react-wrapper';
const apiKey: string = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY;

const MyComponent: React.FunctionComponent = () => (
  <Wrapper apiKey={apiKey}>
    <Map {...args} />
  </Wrapper>
);
```

`@googlemaps/react-wrapper` is listed as a peer dependency in the package.json file. This will allow the package to be smaller when built, but the frontend will need to require it separately.

### Map Markers

As the DirectoryMap component displays either Map or StaticMap, the props passed in are for the StaticMap as these can also be used for the relevant props for the JavaScript Map component.

The JavaScript map will then loop over the map markers and add them as child components to the Map. For example, resulting in something like this:

```jsx
<Map {...args}>
  <MapMarker {...markerOneProps} />
  <MapMarker {...markerTwoProps} />
</Map>
```

## Shortlist

The shortlist makes use of the `DirectoryShortListProvider` within the contexts directory. This allows for easy access to the local storage in multiple different locations and the helper functions.

To allow a componet to access the shortlist context, ensure it is wrapped by the `DirectoryShortListProvider`.

```jsx
<DirectoryShortListProvider>
  <DirectoryAddToShortList {...props} />
</DirectoryShortListProvider>
```

As the context makes use of local storage, it can only be rendered correctly on the client side as the server will not have access to the browser's local storage.
