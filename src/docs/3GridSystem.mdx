# Grid System

A new Grid System has been created to help standardise the layout and the spacing across components and make it easier to build responsive layouts.

The grid system uses two structural components, Row and Column. This is inspired by the GOV.UK Design System Grid System.

https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/layout/#grid-system

## Row

The Row is the outer container and is the full width of it's parent container. It should only contain Column components as it's direct descendents.

### hasBorder

You may set `hasBorder` in the Row props to display the border. This should only be used for demonstration purposes in development and not in the production code.

### isList

If you want to change the Row to be an unordered list \<ul> instead of a \<div>, then set `isList` to true (false by default).

If enabled, the child Column components should also set isList to true so they are list items.

### hasWrap

By default the container will allow the content to wrap onto multiple lines. You can set `hasWrap={false}` to override this behaviour and force content to be on the same line, however, this will only apply on screens wider than the large breakpoint.

## Column

Columns belong within a parent Row component.

The Column allows you to pass in the column width for `small`, `medium` and `large` breakpoints as props.

The available options for the Column widths are:

* full
* one-half
* one-third
* two-thirds
* one-quarter
* three-quarters
* auto

The `auto` option sets `flex-grow: 1` which means the columns will automatically grow to fit the container, depending on how many columns there are and whether the Row has `hasWrap` set to true or false.

The default values will be:

* full for small
* one-half for medium
* one-third for large

### hasPadding

Set `hasPadding={false}` in the Column props to disable the default padding.

### hasBorder

Set `hasBorder={true}` into the Column props to display the border. This should only be used for demonstration purposes in development and not in the production code.

### isList

To be used with `<Row isList>` in the parent Row.

This makes the Column container a \<li> instead of a \<div> which is useful for containing lists of navigation items, but within the grid structure.

## Example

```jsx
<Row>
  <Column small="full" medium="full" large="full">
    <div>Full width</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="one-half" medium="one-half" large="one-half">
    <div>One half</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="one-half" medium="one-half" large="one-half">
    <div>One half</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="three-quarters" medium="three-quarters" large="three-quarters">
    <div>Three quarters</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="one-quarter" medium="one-quarter" large="one-quarter">
    <div>One quarter</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="one-third" medium="one-third" large="one-third">
    <div>One third</div>
  </Column>
  <Column small="two-thirds" medium="two-thirds" large="two-thirds">
    <div>Two thirds</div>
  </Column>
</Row>
```
