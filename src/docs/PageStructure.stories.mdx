# Page Structure

In order to build a page there are several required components that need to be included. All structure related components can be found in an export called `PageStructures` allowing you to include any of these components like this: `<PageStructures.Header />`. All pages follow a similar template, however depending on the content within the page it may require additional components.

At a minimum pages require; the `SkipToMainContent` button, to accessibly allow users to skip the header and breadcrumbs; the `Header` and `Footer` which surround all the page content; the page content then lives within a `MaxWidthContainer` and a `PageMain`.
```
<SkipToMainContent />
<Header />
<MaxWidthContainer>
  <PageMain>
    <!-- All page content goes here -->
  </PageMain>
</MaxWidthContainer>
<Footer />
```

The majority of pages other than the home page will also require a dedicated H1 title which is added using the component `Heading`, and also a breadcrumb trail `<PageStructures.Breadcrumbs />` which should be included within the page template like this:
```
<SkipToMainContent />
<Header />
<MaxWidthContainer>
  <Breadcrumbs />
  <PageMain>
    <Heading level={1} text="Page heading goes here" />

    <!-- All page content goes here -->
  </PageMain>
</MaxWidthContainer>
<Footer />
```

If you want to include a sidebar the page needs an additional wrapper called `PageWithSidebarContainer` which will include the `PageMain` and the `PageSidebar` components within it.
```
<SkipToMainContent />
<Header />
<MaxWidthContainer>
  <Breadcrumbs />
  <PageWithSidebarContainer>
    <PageMain>
      <Heading level={1} text="Page heading goes here" />
      
      <!-- All page content goes here -->
    </PageMain>

    <PageSidebar>
      <!-- All sidebar content goes here -->
    </PageSidebar>
  <PageWithSidebarContainer>
</MaxWidthContainer>
<Footer />
```
